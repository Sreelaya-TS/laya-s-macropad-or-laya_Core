# Laya Core – 4-Key OLED Macropad 

**Honestly this was my first hardware project and this would be my 3rd edit I have added a oled that displays a cute pic**
I made this for fun and exposure to design my own pcb overall the project was fun to make and I had my good time figuring out and learning how a keyboard actualy works from yt videos, documentations and github repos etc. and for this project since I knew python already I have used kmk firmware and all the keys r directly connected to mcu 

This project includes a **custom PCB**, **KMK firmware**, and a **3D-printed case**.

##PARTS USED

- 4 programmable mechanical keys  
- XIAO RP2040 microcontroller  
- OLED display (I2C, 128×64)  
- KMK (CircuitPython-based) firmware  
- Custom PCB designed in KiCad  
- 3D printed enclosure (Fusion 360)
- 4 × M3 × 10 mm self-tapping screws

## Firmware

- Written using **KMK firmware**
- Supports:
  - Custom keyboard shortcuts i just have added (screenshots, copy, paste, etc.)
  - OLED bitmap display (cute robot graphic)

> Firmware source code is available in this repository.
